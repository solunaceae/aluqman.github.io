## Introduction

this is literally just my personal website please don't judge it too harshly

i'm trying my best here

## No, really, what is this?

*sigh*

It's a tiny website built off of a Bootstrap template with a lot (read: a few lines worth) of custom HTML written in to it.

I'm not a web developer. This isn't really meant to be a portfolio, it's just a showcase that
I know what a website is and can do some funky stuff with one.

At some point I'll make something much nicer, but for now, this will do.
